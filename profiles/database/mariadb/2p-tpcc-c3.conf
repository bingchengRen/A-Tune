set the fan to the maximum speed = device
disable the kernel debugging config = kernel
add -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS and -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS compilation option in cmake and the content is that -march is equals to armv8.2-a = compile
use tcmalloc to apply for memory in cmake = compile
optimize cacheline for the database locks = application
split the lock_word of the read/write locks = application
change read/write locks to sequential locks = application
delete the commissioning code and optimize cache-miss = application
